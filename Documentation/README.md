# World of Possibilities
## Project concept from Code Nation's April 2023 Chicago Hackathon
Recreating an intro-level student group's concept from Code Nation's Chicago 2023 hackathon.
To protect the anonymity of the students, no link to the original project will be provided.

This GitHub project aims to recreate the website in the most basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript that students have learned in class (Into to Web Development taught by Code Nation).  This project also aims to mimic the original site as closely as possible.  Given that, much of the information provided in the site is not cited neatly, and the content may not be structured in the best ways.

An updated and more advanced project will be linked to this README.md in the future.
