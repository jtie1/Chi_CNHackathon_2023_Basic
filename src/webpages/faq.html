            <div class="question">
                <h3 id="question1">Are the opportunities only available to immigrants and refugees?</h3>
                <div class="answer" id="answer1">
                    Yes, currently we have resources specifically for immigrants and refugees, 
                    but in the future we hope to be able to help other groups of people as our motto 
                    is nothing is impossible if you're given a fair chance.

            <div class="question">
                <h3 id="question2">Can you apply for these programs, internships, and jobs even if you are 18 or above?</h3>
                <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                    Yes, we offer these opportunities for high school students even if you are 18 or above. 
                    You will just need your log in information to access, that should be provided by your school.

            <div class="question">
                <h3 id="question3">Can I go to graduate school as an undocumented student?</h3>
                <div class="answer" id="answer3">
                    Yes, you can still go to college but chances are you would have to apply as an 
                    international student and we have resources provided for this.

            <div class="question">
                <h3 id="question4">Can my school district require students to provide a social security number?</h3>
                <div class="answer" id="answer4">
                    No. Schools cannot require students to provide a social security number and, consistent with Plyler, 
                    should identify a range of documents (e.g., birth certificate, family bible, parent affidavit) 
                    that may be used to establish a childâ€™s age. Federal law prohibits denial of a benefit for refusal to 
                    supply a social security number, and a school district collecting social security numbers must inform 
                    individuals that the disclosure is voluntary, and must explain both the statutory or other basis for 
                    seeking the numbers, and how the district intends to use the numbers.
